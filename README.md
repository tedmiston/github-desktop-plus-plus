# [WIP] GitHub Desktop++

[GitHub Desktop][0] is a cross-platform GUI Git client; it is minimally configurable which is a detriment to advanced users vs more powerful clients, like Tower.

The purpose of the **_GitHub Desktop++_** fork is to make GHD more useful for advanced Git users.

## Changes from GitHub Desktop upstream

- [ ] **Disable auto-staging of changed files** (https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/1788)
  - Auto-staging all changed files is a bizarre [and annoying][1] default for users that have used any other Git client on earth, which do not do this.

- [ ] **Allow empty commit messages**
  - This feature is useful for non-code repos and for automated commits
  - This is a native feature of git [`--allow-empty-message`][2] which GHD blocks use of
  - Other git clients allow this natively, but GitHub Desktop does not

- [ ] **Auto-stash and unstash**
  - [Automatic stashing][3] (like Tower) when required

- [ ] **Disable false positive misattributed commits warning badge**
  - Use case: you have a repository like an Obsidian vault using robotic commits that you don't want to affect your GitHub stats
  - GitHub Desktop also shows this [attribution warning][4] any time the email in the Git config isn't connected to your GitHub account

- [ ] **Hide *Install Command Line Tool...* menu item when it's already installed**

- [ ] **Support for multiple GitHub.com accounts**
