# GitHub Desktop *Plus Plus*

**WIP**

[GitHub Desktop][0] is a cross-platform GUI Git client.  It is minimally configurable which is a detriment to advanced users vs more powerful clients, like Tower.

The purpose of this fork is to make GHD more useful for advanced Git users.

## Changes from GitHub Desktop upstream

- **Disable auto-staging of changed files** (https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/1788)
  - Auto-staging all changed files is a bizarre [and annoying][1] default for users that have used any other Git client on earth, which do not do this.
